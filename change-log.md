# Change Log - Gitty Up

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- `--ignore-untracked` option to allow updates even when untracked files are present (addresses GitHub issue #2)
  - Performs safety checks to ensure untracked files won't be overwritten by pull
  - Fetches from origin and checks for potential conflicts before pulling
  - Distinguishes between untracked files (safe with checks) and modified files (still skipped)
  - Only proceeds with pull if no conflicts detected between untracked files and incoming changes
- Always-ignored files list for common working files that don't block updates (addresses GitHub issue #2)
  - `.DS_Store` (macOS file system metadata)
  - `Thumbs.db` (Windows thumbnail cache)
  - `__pycache__` (Python bytecode cache directories)
  - These files are automatically filtered when determining if a repository has uncommitted changes
  - Repositories with only these files are treated as clean and can be updated

### Changed
- Improved uncommitted files detection to distinguish between untracked vs modified/staged files
- Enhanced skip reason logging to provide more specific information about why repos were skipped
- Modified `get_repo_status()` and `async_get_repo_status()` to filter out always-ignored files
- Updated `has_only_untracked_files()` to automatically exclude always-ignored files from consideration

### Fixed
- Fixed `--explain` recommendation to include directory path when scanning non-current directories
  - Now correctly shows `gittyup /path/to/dir --explain` instead of just `gittyup --explain`
  - Prevents confusion when users scan a different directory than their current working directory
