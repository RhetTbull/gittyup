## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Concurrent Batch Processing** - Complete âœ…
  - Asynchronous repository updates using asyncio for dramatic performance improvements
  - Default batch processing: updates 3 repositories simultaneously
  - New CLI options:
    - `--batch-size N` / `-b N`: Configure number of concurrent repository updates (default: 3)
    - `--sync` / `-s`: Force sequential processing for debugging or careful monitoring
  - Intelligent batch output: displays batch groups with ordered results after completion
  - Safe concurrent operations: maintains all existing safety checks and error handling
  - Backward compatible: all existing functions remain available
  - Performance optimization: network I/O happens concurrently while waiting for git operations
  - Clear visual feedback: shows which repos are updating in each batch
  - Async implementation in `git_operations.py`: 
    - `async_update_repository_with_log()` - Main async update function
    - `_async_run_git_command()` - Core async subprocess wrapper
    - `async_pull_repository_detailed()` - Async pull with detailed results
  - Batch orchestration in `cli.py`:
    - `async_update_repos_in_batches()` - Manages concurrent batch processing
    - Modified main update loop for async operation
  - Documentation updates:
    - Updated readme with batch processing explanation and examples
    - New FAQ entry explaining concurrency and performance benefits
    - Updated command reference with new CLI options
    - New workflow examples: "Performance Mode" and "Safe and Sequential"
  - Updated example output to show batch-based processing format

### Fixed
- **Explain Output Labeling** - Complete âœ…
  - Fixed misleading "Changed repositories:" header in `--explain` output
  - Now properly separates repositories into distinct sections:
    - "Unchanged repositories:" (up-to-date repos, compact format)
    - "Updated repositories:" (repos that were actually updated)
    - "Skipped repositories:" (repos that couldn't be updated)
    - "Error repositories:" (repos with errors)
  - Improves clarity and prevents confusion when viewing skipped repositories
  - Each section now has appropriate color coding (green for updated, yellow for skipped, red for errors)

### Added
- **Alphabetical Repository Sorting** - Complete âœ…
  - Repositories now processed and reported in alphabetical order by name
  - Applies to both normal operation output and `--explain` command output
  - Within the explain output, repositories are also sorted alphabetically within each status group
  - Improves consistency and makes it easier to find specific repositories in output
  - Works seamlessly with existing features and sorting criteria

- **Compact Explain Output for Unchanged Repos** - Complete âœ…
  - Unchanged (up-to-date) repositories now display as single compact lines in `--explain` output
  - Format: `ðŸ’¤ repo-name - Already up-to-date`
  - Unchanged repos grouped together at the top for easy scanning
  - Changed repos (updated, skipped, error) shown below with full details
  - Improves readability when dealing with many up-to-date repositories
  - All existing tests pass (65 tests in test_output.py)
  
- **Uncommitted Files Display** - Complete âœ…
  - New `UncommittedFile` data model with status tracking (Modified, Untracked, Deleted, Added, etc.)
  - Enhanced `get_uncommitted_files()` function to parse git status --porcelain output
  - Detailed file listing in `--explain` output when repositories are skipped due to uncommitted changes
  - Color-coded status indicators: yellow for modified, cyan for untracked, red for deleted, green for added
  - Smart truncation: shows first 15 files with "... and N more files" message for readability
  - 13 new comprehensive tests for uncommitted files functionality
  - Updated logger deserialization to support UncommittedFile objects
  - Seamless integration with existing logging and explain infrastructure
  - Coverage maintained at 92% with 211 total tests passing

- **CLI Enhancement - Explain Command Suggestion** - Complete âœ…
  - Automatic suggestion to run `gittyup --explain` after operations with updates, skips, or errors
  - Smart detection: only shows suggestion when there are noteworthy changes
  - Non-intrusive: only appears in non-quiet mode after normal operations
  - Helps users discover detailed logging feature without overwhelming them
  
- **Logging and Explain Feature** - Complete âœ…
  - âœ… **Phase 1: Foundation** - Dependencies (platformdirs, diskcache), data models, LogManager, unit tests
  - âœ… **Phase 2: Enhanced Git Operations** - Commit details, file changes, git output parsing
  - âœ… **Phase 3: CLI Integration** - --explain flag, log saving, operation tracking  
  - âœ… **Phase 4: Explain Output** - Rich formatted output with detailed operation history
  - âœ… **Phase 5: Testing and Polish** - 216 total tests passing with 91.93% coverage
  - âœ… **Phase 6: Documentation** - Complete readme, troubleshooting, FAQ, and release notes
  
  **Key Features:**
  - Persistent operation logging with OS-specific cache directories (macOS, Linux, Windows)
  - Detailed log data: commits, file changes, errors, timing, branch info
  - `--explain` command to review previous operations without re-running
  - Zero impact on normal CLI outputâ€”logging happens silently
  - JSON-based storage for human readability and debuggability
  - Comprehensive test coverage with 101 new tests for logging functionality
  - Cross-platform cache location support via platformdirs
  - Efficient key-value storage with diskcache
  
  **Documentation:**
  - Updated readme.md with --explain flag usage and examples
  - Added cache location documentation for all platforms
  - Added troubleshooting guide for logging issues
